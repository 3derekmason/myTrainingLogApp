# _My Training Log App_

---

## Description

Over the years, my background as a personal trainer has led me through an assortment of _training apps_ and tinkering with my own preffered methods of _logging my own workouts_.
Since nothing has ever matched exactly what I want, I decided to take things into my own hands...
<br>
<br>

MTLA is a full stack (MERN) application including:

- User login and signup with bcrypt authorization
<div>
  <img src="./client/public/assets/login.png" width="240">
  <img src="./client/public/assets/signup.png" width="240">
  </div>

- Log View or This Week view of stored workouts.

- Add workout to any date in log.

- Customize personal exercise libraries.

> My Training Log App began just for **me**... But I hope it's something you will enjoy as well!
